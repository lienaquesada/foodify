# Project2

Specifically being a food application to track the items you current have, you are able to load these items and update in the database to make sure that you are buying things you do not already have. This application has the ability to add items to the categories list, add and delete items from your current inventory, and search meals you are able to make with any specific item you have in your inventory. 

Purpose: 
To be able to track the food items in your kitchen and also see what possible combinations you will be able to create using those items.

Trial Steps:
- Download the entire work file to your personal computer. 
- Make sure to copy the Schema file for MySQL into your local workbench and create all necessary database and tables. 
- Change the password in the connections.js to your current password with MySQL Workbench to create the connection with the server.
- On the 'sign-up' page create a username and password
- Using the login page, complete the steps to login and start using the application

Future processes to take place:
- Create a 'favorites' page where you are able to save a library of your favorite recipes.
- Add a brand new 'category' along with new 'food item' or add a 'food item' to a preexisting 'category'
- Delete items from your 'current inventory' drop down
- Create a fully functioning token for the log in area
- Change the search input to be able to check-boxes in the dropdown to be able to add the items you prefer and run them through the recipe API
- Add the ability to return up to 10 recipes from the API that include all possible recipes with your selected food items
